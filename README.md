# Equal-Weight S&P 500 Screener

According to Investopedia, the S&P 500 Index (Standard & Poor's 500 Index) features 500 leading U.S. publicly traded companies. Because of its depth and diversity, the S&P 500 Index is one of the best gauges of prominent American equities' performance, and by extension, that of the overall stock market. S&P 500 is market capitalization-weighted, implying that larger companies get a correspondingly larger weight in the index. However, our project will build an equal-weight version of the S&P 500 index, meaning each company has the same weighting.

Although we cannot directly invest in the S&P 500 since it's an index, we still can invest in the many investment funds that use it as a benchmark. These funds seek to replicate its composition and performance by owning all stocks held in this index.
